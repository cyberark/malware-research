#### Strings Deobfuscation

- Find the decryption function address by searching (pattern-based) the decryption algorithm.

- Gets all dynamic calls's addresses of in the binary.

- Deobfuscates the dynamic calls's address and compares it to the decryption function address.

- Gets the data that of the arguments for evrey call

- Deobfuscates and descrypt the string using the `get_obf_string` function.

The script set reference and comment for each dynamic call to the decryption function. Besides, it writes the decrypted string on each location, and it dumps the addresses and the full decrypted strings to a JSON file named `ficker_strings_dump.json`.


## Usage

To use the script, you can load it to IDA while the **courser** is in *Main function* or you can call the function from IDA command line:

```python
ficker_setup(MAIN_ADDRESS)
```
